The Data:
1.	Foursquare API gives data of boroughs, neighborhoods, venues, venue categories and their LngLat data.
2.	New York City restaurant list:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_restaurants_in_New_York_City
There are coordinate data for each restaurant if following the links.
3.	New York City Community areas, where we can find out the areas and population / square KM  of each CB:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_New_York_City

The solution:
1.	Work out a list of restaurants together with their types and the neighborhoods from Foursquare data.
2.	Work out a list of population per square KM for each neighborhood.
3.	Work out a function to give the prioritized list ordered by least number of restaurant / pop. Per square KM, by giving a restaurant type as the parameter.

Success Criteria:
The success criteria of the project will be giving out lists of prioritized list of neighborhoods for each restaurant type in New York City.
